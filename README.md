# Multi-Agent System for Campus Virtual Tour

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent system to assist visitors in navigating a campus and meeting their hosts. The system utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) and CrewAI framework for agent communication and coordination.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Utilizes SLAM for real-time environment mapping and obstacle detection.
- **Efficient Communication**: Employs CrewAI for structured interactions between Campus Incharge (CI) and Building Incharge (BI) agents.
- **Simulation**: Implemented with TurtleBot3 robots in Gazebo for testing agent behaviors.

## Technologies
- **ROS**: For distributed agent management and path planning.
- **CrewAI**: For managing agent decision-making and multi-agent coordination.
- **TurtleBot3**: Used for simulations to represent agents.
